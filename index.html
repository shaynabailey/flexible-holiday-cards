                        <p>
                            Banana Laffy Taffy is a disgrace to the entire Laffy Taffy brand. Am I a bit biased because I hate banana and any artifically flavored banana products? Perhaps. However, just think about it. What kid on Halloween has ever been like, "Yeah, you know what I hope we get alot of tonight trick or treating? BANANA LAFFY TAFFY!" That sounds crazy right? Because it totally is. Good puns on the back of the wrapper cant make up for how gross the candy actually is.

                            I mean do I really need to justify this one. It's just icky and it makes your mouth look like you got a instant case of gingivitus.

                        <p>
                            For this one I'm just confused why they were ever even a thing that someone thought wood be good to produce commercially. I remember trying them when I was younger and they were just dry and dusty, plus they made your mouth dry. Just an overall crusty "candy".<div class=""></div>

                        <p>
                            Dots don't have a good array of flavors and are way too sticky. I understand that candy is sticky, but Dots are just way too untastefully sticky.

                        <p>
                            I don't think I have any personal beef with candy corn, my issue is with the frequency it is given out as a "defualt candy". It's the safe candy of the entire halloween selection and almost every house would have them. There is definetly a such thing as too much candy corn.
